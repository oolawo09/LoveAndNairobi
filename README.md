			Love and Nairobi: Artist's Statement			

I chose to write my final project as a Hypertext narratives because of the rich set of 

libraries available that I could use to augment my narrative. In particular, I chose to use 

HTML, CSS and jQuery to write a narrative that integrates text with various multimedia 

elements seamlessly in order to tell a riveting story. 

The story consists of four main subplots each of which is contained in a single web 

page. The first is an overarching one whereby the history of the KICC is told, and along 

with it, the political history of the country and Nairobi. The second subplot has the main 

character and Ciru-- a good friend of his-- having an intimate moment at the top of the 

KICC, which is followed by another subplot where the main character visits Ciru in her 

university hostel for a movie date. And, finally, the concluding subplot whereby the main 

character becomes a victim of a terror attack on his way to visit Ciru. Each of these 

subplots is split into modules contained in a web page’s div element. These are brought 

together by a the narrative’s structure. 

The structure of this hypertext narrative differs significantly from the original text version; 

Ironically, it is more temporally linear than the original text is. Hypertext narrative 

authors usually break down their story into events and link these to each other in a 

graph-like structure. A reader’s unique traversal of this graph will then result in them 

moving from event to create a unique story each time. While, according to Joyce 

in ‘Hypertext Pedagogy and Poetics,’ most hypertext narratives leverage their hypertext 

nature to create complex graphs whose traversal gives rise to a different story each 

time, my graph was very simple. And, it is very temporally linear in comparison to my 

original text that started at the story’s conclusion, skipped back and forth temporally 

before returning to the conclusion. In fact, by Rimmon-Kenan’s standards, the hypertext 

version is much more of a story than the original text; the events follow each other 

chronologically. 

However, transitions from one node of the graph to the other still play an important 

function in this story. Each node holds a module and the reader moves from one node 

to the next either by ‘sliding’ from div element to div element within a page or by moving 

from the last div element of a page to the first div element of the next page by clicking 

on a hyperlink. The divs within each page resemble comic book panels. However, they 

contain text mostly and the story is continuous from panel to panel therefore the reader 

doesn’t need to use their closure to fill in the gaps. The sliding from div to div offers a 

very smooth transition from event to event which further supplements the continuity 

of the various subplots. On the other hand the more abrupt movement from page to 

page signals a distinct break from one subplot to the next. The links then serve are 

literary connections that offer themselves up for interpretation along with the rest of the 

narrative. (Bernstein and Greco, 167)

Within these nodes, the narrative’s digital instantiation opens it up to a rich library of 

new storytelling elements. Narration is still the primary vehicle by which the story is told, 

however, I’ve used various audio tracks to augment the narration. Most interestingly, 

I used audio to narrate the movie date and terror attack. While, the movie date track 

is a succession of sounds signalling, the terror attack track is an actual narration from 

the point of view of the main character. Here I sought to do the opposite of what visual 

does; instead of presenting the audience with a clear idea of what exactly happened, I 

gave them signals and let their imaginations decipher them and flesh that bit of the story 

out. In the interview “Noise, Storytelling with Sound, and Visuals on the Radio” Jad Abumrad 

talks about how sound couldn’t put across what the sight of watching a school of fish 

did. The sight was very clear and distinct and offers no room for the viewer to imagine 

what a school of fish would look like. I tried to do the opposite with this audio track 

and instead gave the listener the room to imagine because it would create space for 

uncertainty therefore developing a sense of chaos. This mirrors the high entropy-esque 

nature of a terror attack accurately. 

I also used visuals to augment the story. Most interestingly, I used a picture of Kenyatta 

to anchor his character status in the story. This picture was a black and white profile 

of him in the 1960s. In it he looks austere yet elegant in a fashionable gray suit. It is 

a powerful combination. In addition to this, I used two images to set the scene and 

mood while narrating the subplot whereby the main character and Ciru were on the 

top of the KICC. These images were symbolic on two levels. First of all I used them 

as backgrounds to blocks of text which was symbolic. Secondly, the images set the 

mood of the scene at the top of the KICC. They were shot in the evening, and as such, 

capture the mellow mood of that time of the day which matches the tone of the subplot. 

Most importantly, I used various techniques to play around with the text in my last 

subplot. Here I was able to use a jQuery library to animate text going a step further than 

I did with the print iteration of my story whereby elements, once put on paper, remained 

static. For instance, I had the text that signalled the grenade explosion in my story 

slide in from the right and grow bigger as the reader scrolled down the page whose 

background also progressively darkened to pitch black. This offers a literal yet powerful 

interpretation of the actual terror attack. I also animated a number of objects within the 

same page to represent the chaos at the bus stop when the explosion occurred. These 

objects represented various physical elements in the real world such as flames, bodies 

and shards of glass; all of these bounced around on screen as the reader scrolled down 

before finally settling at the bottom of the page. 

All in all, this project leverages a rich collection of story telling tools to tell a vivid story. 

It Maintains a simple narrative structure augmented by various multimedia elements to 

bring the story to life.
