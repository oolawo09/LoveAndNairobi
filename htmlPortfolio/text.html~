	<h2>LOVE AND NAIROBI</h2>
<p>
	I can feel the strict matatu frame ricket around me. The speakers flush out Gregory Isaacs, dusty and loud. They belt out, &quot if you want to be my number one, if you want to be my number one, let me know your... &quot
</p>

<p>
	Nairobi was always a hub of pithy chaos, and it still is.  The chaos traffics in and out of the city center via Uhuru highway, Ngong road etc. It often feels like an angry fix: a tight knot of human activity twisted about itself like electric copper wiring.
</p>
<p>

	I feel the matatu swerve to a stop. The conductor pulls at the minivan door and it lunges open. It wheezes past my shoulder to unveil a sparse handful of yet more Nairobians at the Chiromo Campus stage. I consciously juggle my left then right foot onto the tarmac before straightening out my shirt and steadying myself.
</p>
<p>

	As I head up Chiromo road into Chiromo campus, boom! The sun goes out.
</p>
<p>	
	Then it flickers back on, loudly. I&#39m on the ground and it&#39s rumbling. Then boom! Again. But this time the sun doesn&#39t go out. Instead, it dims momentarily before flickering back to half of its full brightness. I can feel the tarmac hot and hard against the side of my face. The sun is now back to its full brightness and is no longer flickering so I roll onto my back and lift my head to look back at the stage. The matatu sits limp on its four wheels, burning. The rickety frame is now a hellishly hot cage and there are people in it and thick black smoke. Thick black people tossing and turning and thick black smoke and the radio is still on. The engine is whirring. The speakers are revving out Gregory Isaacs, &quot if you want to be, to be, my, if you want to... &quot It all sounds old and dirty and slow, a sickening dirge.
</p>
<p>	
	Then the rest of the world un-mutes and I can hear a man screaming, &quot Al-Shabaab! Al-Shabaab!&quot Nairobi seems to be melting away around the matatu as it continues to burn even more hotly. Everything is such a fucking mess. And then boom. The sun goes out again.
</p>
<p>	
	Two days before the terror attack I&#39d hopped off a matatu at the same stage and promptly headed up Chiromo road towards the main hostels where Ciru lived. We&#39d been best friends for four years and I&#39d go see her whenever I could. This time I had two orders of chicken rotisserie with me as well as two pirated DVDs: the second season of Suits and the first season of Ray Donovan and when I got to her room we ate, laughed and loved.
</p>
<p>	
	Four days before the terror attack Ciru and I climbed to the top of KICC.</p>
<p>
	
	The Kenyatta International Conference Center is arguably the most significant landmark in Nairobi. It stands erect, off of the catholic, largely concrete base that paves most of this metropolitan city, Kenya&#39s capital city. This building, at whose tip Ciru and I were now standing, shelters the tattered remains of, KANU-the Kenya African National Union, which was Kenya&#39s ruling party for forty years. 
</p>
<p> 
	As we stood at the edge of the helipad looking down at the maze of humanity that is Nairobi, I could feel a connection to each one of them. I was a part of the maze. But at least I&#39d found my way to Ciru who was now standing right in front of me. My hands instinctively moved around her waist; she leaned backward into my chest; rested her head on my right shoulder and clasped her palms over my hands. The view was breathtaking. It felt like we were looking at life through Allah&#39s eyes.
</p>
<p>
	I could feel Ciru&#39s life threaten to drip over, leak out of her, down the sides of the wall, past glass windows, and windowpanes and window cleaners in their overalls dusting windows with dirty rags. She&#39d probably evaporate before she hit the ground.  For a split second I pictured myself dripping down the sides of this building, catching up and coalescing with her. I could feel us evaporate off of hot stone wall before diffusing into Nairobi. I could feel atoms of us bouncing around the maze: we would bounce off of armfuls of windscreen wipers and key chains and past the hawkers running in between tightly braided lines of traffic trying to peddle those wares to the drivers; we would bounce around all the chaotic patterns of humanity that characterised downtown Nairobi. All this while skating on sheets of wind, into clouds of exhaust fumes and right into indestructible walls of noise--car horns, loud music and bus conductors talking at their customers. Then we would eventually condense and puddle up right in front of the Odeon bus stage where the matatus to Chiromo pick up their passengers.
</p>
<p>
	Six days before the terror attack I told Ciru that I loved her. And for the few seconds, right before she replied, she was my girlfriend and girlfriend.  </p>
<p>
	A day after the terror attack the following excerpt will be published as part of a longer article:
	 &quot Former ruling party Kanu has vowed to repossess the KICC, which was allegedly grabbed by former officials after it was dislodged from power. Party Secretary General Nick Salat said the party &quot was in the process of instituting legal measures to ensure that the assets are recovered. &quot And that  &quot some of Kanu&#39s property was in the hands of Government officials who grabbed the party’s assets before ditching the party. &quot (Karanja Njoroge the Standard Mon oct 22nd 2012 )
</p>	
<p>
	The KICC isn&#39t smack in the middle of the city or even the country but was slapped close enough to it by the very incestuous father of the nation -Jommo Kenyatta. Incestuous because Jommo, the father of this nation by virtue of being its first prime minister and president, egotistically stroked this building to erection: a mass of concrete pulsating with the heat and fervor of premature independence, he stroked it to completion in four years before proceeding to use the building to fuck the entire country senseless, to a climax that clouded the not so virgin Nairobi sky.  And now his successors were getting ready to reenact it all with what was left of Kenyatta’s crude political phallus. It signifies a hellish end to something that was almost beautiful.
