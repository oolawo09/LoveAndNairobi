    <h2>Love and Nairobi: Unfolding in Time</h2>
<p>
Six days before the attack: 
The persona in the story is going to write a soliloquy on love as a blog article. This soliloquy will explore different kinds of love. It will explore platonic love, drawing heavily from Plato&#39s writings on love in the symposium before exploring love as a robust concern for others. 
</p>
<p>
He will also tweet the following from his personal handle, &#34I told Ciru that I loved her. For  a split second she was my girlfriend and best friend.&#34 
</p>
<p>
Four days before the attack: 
The persona in the story is going to write another blog article. This article will be about how the KICC came into being and the role it played for Kenya&#39s first president. He will then write about the time he and Ciru spent on top of the KICC while focussing on what impact the view of the rest of Nairobi had on that particular moment. 
</p>
<p>
Two days before the attack: 
The persona is going to write one last blog post about the tv shows Ray Donovan and Suits. When writing about Ray Donovan, he&#39ll focus on the main character&#39s inability to tell his wife the entire truth about his day to day shady dealings that put food on his family&#39s table. On the other hand, when writing about Suits&#39 main character, he&#39ll focus on his inability to develop robust concern for others at the expense of making himself seem vulnerable. 
</p>
<p>
The persona will also tweet about hanging out with Ciru. 
</p>
<p>
The day of the attack: 
Here I plan on writing a fake Reuters article covering the terror attack. It&#39ll include statistics on how many people died; how many were injured and analysis  on the potential impact of the attack on the Kenyan economy. This will be in addition to twitter handles for the following journalists--Andrew Simmons, Jeff Koinange and Catherine Wambua-- all of whom will be tweeting about the terror attack in real time.   
</p>
<p>
1 days after the terror attack: 
I also plan on creating an alternate US Department of State twitter handle to tweet about a travel warning to Kenya. The tweet will contain a link to a US Department of State web page that has a longer list of travel warnings to Pakistan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq, Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt and Haiti in addition to Kenya. The warnings will be listed in chronologically, with the most recent warning (The Kenyan one), coming first. 
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I&#39ll create a twitter handle for Ciru and she&#39ll tweet a link to an article about KANU&#39s plans to recover the KICC.
