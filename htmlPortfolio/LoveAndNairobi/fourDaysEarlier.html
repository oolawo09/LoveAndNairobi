    <p class="center">Four days before the terror attack Ciru and I climbed to the top of KICC.
 
The Kenyatta International Conference Center is arguably the most significant landmark in Nairobi. It stands erect, off of the catholic, largely concrete base that paves most of this metropolitan city, Kenya&#8216s capital city. This building, at whose tip Ciru and I were now standing, shelters the tattered remains of, KANU-the Kenya African National Union, which was Kenya&#8216s ruling party for forty years.  
 As we stood at the edge of the helipad looking down at the maze of humanity that is Nairobi, I could feel a connection to each one of them. I was a part of the maze. But at least I&#8216d found my way to Ciru who was now standing right in front of me. My hands instinctively moved around her waist; she leaned backward into my chest; rested her head on my right shoulder and clasped her palms over my hands. The view was breathtaking. It felt like we were looking at life through Allah&#8216s eyes.
I could feel Ciru&#8216s life threaten to drip over, leak out of her, down the sides of the wall, past glass windows, and windowpanes and window cleaners in their overalls dusting windows with dirty rags. She&#8216d probably evaporate before she hit the ground.  For a split second I pictured myself dripping down the sides of this building, catching up and coalescing with her. I could feel us evaporate off of hot stone wall before diffusing into Nairobi. I could feel atoms of us bouncing around the maze: we would bounce off of armfuls of windscreen wipers and key chains and past the hawkers running in between tightly braided lines of traffic trying to peddle those wares to the drivers; we would bounce around all the chaotic patterns of humanity that characterised downtown Nairobi. All this while skating on sheets of wind, into clouds of exhaust fumes and right into indestructible walls of noiseâ€”car horns, loud music and bus conductors talking at their customers. Then we would eventually condense and puddle up right in front of the Odeon bus stage where the matatus to Chiromo pick up their passengers.
Six days before the terror attack I told Ciru that I loved her. And for the few seconds, right before she replied, she was my girlfriend and best friend.
