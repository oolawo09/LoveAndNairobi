back to half of its full brightness. I can feel the tarmac hot and hard against the side of my face. 

The sun is now back to its full brightness and is no longer flickering so I roll onto my back and lift my head to look back at the stage. The matatu sits limp on its four wheels, burning. The rickety frame is now a hellishly hot cage and there are people in it and thick black smoke. The radio is still on. The engine is whirring. The speakers are revving out Collo's verse, .&#8221if you want to be, to be, my, if you want to...&#8221 It all sounds old and dirty and slow, a sickening dirge.
Then the rest of the world un-mutes and I can hear a man screaming, “AL-SHABAAB! AL-SHABAAB ! ” Nairobi seems to be melting away around the matatu as it continues to burn even more hotly. Everything is such a fucking mess. And then boom. The sun goes out again.
