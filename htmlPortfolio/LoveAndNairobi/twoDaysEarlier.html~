    I feel the matatu swerve to a stop. The conductor pulls at the minivan door and it lunges open. It wheezes past my shoulder to unveil a handful of yet more Nairobians at the Chiromo Campus stage. I consciously juggle my left then right foot onto the tarmac before straightening out my shirt and steadying myself.
