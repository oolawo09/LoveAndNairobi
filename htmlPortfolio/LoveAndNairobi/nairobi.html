<a href="index.html">	<p class="left">Nairobi was always a hub of pithy chaos, and it still is.  The chaos traffics in and out of the city center via Uhuru highway, Ngong road etc. It often feels like an angry fix: a tight knot of human activity twisted about itself like electric copper wiring.

The Kenyatta international conference center is arguably the most significant landmark in Nairobi. It stands erect, off of the catholic, largely concrete base that paves most of this metropolitan city, Kenya’s capital city. It isn’t smack in the middle of the city or even the country but was slapped close enough to it by the very incestuous father of the nation -Jommo Kenyatta. Incestuous because Jommo, the father of this nation by virtue of being its first prime minister and president, egotistically stroked this building to erection: a mass of concrete pulsating with the heat and fervor of premature independence, he stroked it to completion in four years before proceeding to use the building to fuck the entire country senseless, to a climax that clouded the not so virgin Nairobi sky.  The building housed, and continues to shelter the tattered remains of, KANU-the Kenya African National Union.

 And now his successors are getting ready to reenact it all with what was left of Kenyatta’s crude political phallus. It signifies a hellish end to something that was almost beautiful.
