    <p class="left"><a href="fourDaysEarlier.html">Two days before the terror attack I&#8216d hopped off a matatu at the same stage and promptly headed up Chiromo road towards the main hostels where Ciru lived. We&#8216d been best friends for four years and I&#8216d go see her whenever I could. This time I had two orders of chicken rotisserie with me as well as two pirated DVDs: the second season of Suits and the first season of Ray Donovan and when I got to her room we ate, laughed and loved.</a></p>
