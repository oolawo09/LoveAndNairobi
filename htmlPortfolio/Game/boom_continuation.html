      back to half of its full brightness. You can feel the tarmac hot and hard against the side of my face. 

      The sun is now back to its full brightness and is no longer flickering so you roll onto your back and lift your head to look back at the stage. The matatu sits limp on its four wheels, burning. The rickety frame is now a hellishly hot cage and there are people in it and thick black smoke. The radio is still on. The engine is whirring. The speakers are revving out P-UNIT, .&#8221 she can gi, she can, she can give...&#8221 It all sounds old and dirty and slow, a sickening dirge.
      Then the rest of the world un-mutes and I can hear a man screaming,<a href="al-shabaab.html"> &#8221AL-SHABAAB! AL-SHABAAB ! &#8221</a> Nairobi seems to be melting away around the matatu as it continues to burn even more hotly. Everything is such a fucking mess. And then boom. The sun goes out again.
