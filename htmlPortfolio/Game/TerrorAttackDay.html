    <p>You can feel the strict matatu frame ricket around you.

You feel the matatu swerve to a stop. The conductor pulls at the minivan door and it lunges open. It wheezes past my shoulder to unveil a handful of yet more Nairobians at the Chiromo Campus stage. You consciously juggle my left then right foot onto the tarmac before straightening out your shirt and steadying yourself.

 As you head up Chiromo road into Chiromo campus,<a href="boom.html"> boom!</a>
