	<p>The KICC isnâ€™t smack in the middle of the city or even the country but was slapped close enough to it by the very incestuous father of the nation-- <a href="kenyatta.html">Jommo Kenyatta. 

Incestuous because Jommo, the father of this nation by virtue of being its first prime minister and president, egotistically stroked this building to erection: a mass of concrete pulsating with the heat and fervor of premature independence, he stroked it to completion in four years before proceeding to use the building to fuck the entire country senseless, to a climax that clouded the not so virgin Nairobi sky.
