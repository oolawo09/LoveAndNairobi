Four days before the terror attack Ciru and you climbed to the top of KICC.

<p class="left">As you stand at the edge of the helipad looking down at the maze of humanity that is Nairobi, you&#39ll feel a connection to each one of them. You are a part of the maze. But at least youu&#39ve found your way to Ciru who is now standing right in front of you. Your hands instinctively move around her waist; she leans backward into your chest; rests her head on your right shoulder and clasps her palms over your hands. The view is breathtaking. It feels like you are looking at life through Allahu&#39s eyes.
You can feel Ciruu&#39s life threaten to drip over, leak out of her, down the sides of the wall, past glass windows, and windowpanes and window cleaners in their overalls dusting windows with dirty rags. Sheu&#39d probably evaporate before she hit the ground.  For a split second you picture yourself dripping down the sides of this building, catching up and coalescing with her. You can feel both of you evaporate off of hot stone wall before diffusing into Nairobi. You can feel atoms of you bouncing around the maze: you bounce off of armfuls of windscreen wipers and key chains and past the hawkers running in between tightly braided lines of traffic trying to peddle those wares to the drivers; you bounce around all the chaotic patterns of humanity that characterise downtown Nairobi. All this while skating on sheets of wind, into clouds of exhaust fumes and right into indestructible walls of noiseâ€”car horns, loud music and bus conductors talking at their customers. Then you eventually condense and puddle up right in front of the Odeon bus stage where the matatus to Chiromo pick up their passengers.
