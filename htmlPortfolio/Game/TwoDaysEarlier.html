You hop off a matatu at the Chiromo stage and promptly headed up Chiromo road towards the main hostels where Ciru lives. You've been best friends for four years and you go see her whenever you can. This time you have two orders of chicken rotisserie with you as well as two pirated DVDs: the second season of Suits and the first season of Ray Donovan and when you get to her room you eat, laugh and love.
